# Speech Emotion Classification by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network: A deep learning approach - By Emil Vinod
  - To Understand the Methodology and Basic Concepts behind the Project please check out README-(Methodology).md
  - To follow preprocessing and model code please check the 'Emotion Audio Classification using Convolutional Neural Network ~ Emil Vinod' ipynb file
  - **To *TRY* the model *YOURSELF* use the 'Predict' ipynb file (Make sure to save a Recording.wav file)**
  - Enjoy :)
